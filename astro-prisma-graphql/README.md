# Astro with GraphQL, Prisma and MongoDB

- SSR mode for server rendering.
- GraphQL endpoint for GQL request handling.
- Prisma data modelling and database access methods.
- MongoDB connection for reading and writing real data to a bonefide datasource.

> **NOTE** this example repo is in development
